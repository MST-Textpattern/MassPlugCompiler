p. Originally build in couple minutes some years ago to ease building installer files for new Textpattern releases.

p. Main difference to the official 4.x plugin template, is that "MassPlugCompiler" builds packages from separated source files instead of using single template files. TextPacks (translations), source code and help files can be split into individual files. That way translators don't need to fiddle with code and can freely use text auto-correction and dictionary tools.

p. Sources can be splits into directory tree similar to:

bc. /releases/
	/xxx_plugin_name/
		/0.1/
			name.txt
			author.txt
			author_uri.txt
			description.txt
			help.txt
			code.php
			type.txt
			load_order.txt
			flags.txt
			textpack.txt
		/0.2/
			[ . . . ]
	/xxx_plugin_name/
		/0.1/
			[ . . . ]
	[ . . . ]

p. Requirements:

* PHP5
* Textpattern (optional). Can be loaded using Textpattern's plugin cache directory.

p. By default plugin sources are searched from "../plugins/releases" and packages are saved to "../plugins/packages".

p. If rah_plugcompile.php is loaded via Textpattern, the paths can be changed in Textpattern's Preferences pane. Otherwise $prefs['rah_plugcompile_packages'], $prefs['rah_plugcompile_releases'] and $prefs['rah_plugcompile_active'] globals can be used to control the preferences.

p. By default the $prefs['rah_plugcompile_active'] is set to 0 (false) and the compiler is disabled.
